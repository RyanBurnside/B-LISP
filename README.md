# B-LISP

The primary goal of B-LISP is to look and act like a heritage Lisp. Hence the old-style capitalization.

It's a learning project that may grow into more.

I picked BlitzMax because it will let me expose multimedia and easily compile self-contained binaries.

## Features

- **Traditional Names and Symbols:** If you want syntax noise, go use Perl or Python.
- **Traditional Notions of `t` and `NIL`/`'()`:** No mixing "false" and "nil".
- **Variadic Primitives Where Sensible.**

While B-LISP is not strictly Common Lisp nor Scheme, it mostly aligns with these.

The inspiration for B-LISP is the excellent [TinyLisp](https://github.com/Robert-van-Engelen/tinylisp).
